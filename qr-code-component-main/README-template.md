Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use my margins very well. I never knew how to center images or divs properly but this was a breakthrough for me.



### Continued development

I want to focus on flexbox develoment and aligning objects properly especially when making a responsive page
